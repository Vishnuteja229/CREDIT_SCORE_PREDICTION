# CREDIT_SCORE_PREDICTION
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to classify credit scores into predefined categories. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using popular algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Tree.
Introduction
Credit score classification is a vital task for financial institutions to evaluate credit risk. This project applies data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to achieve accurate classification of credit scores. The performance of models like Random Forest and Decision Tree is evaluated and compared.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes features that contribute to determining an individual's credit score. These features include financial history, income, outstanding loans, and more.
Models and Results
The following models were trained and evaluated:

Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: 80%
Decision Tree Classifier

Accuracy: 75%
Random Forest (Alternative configuration)

Accuracy: 76%
Model performance metrics such as precision, recall, and confusion matrices are detailed in the results section of the notebook/script.
